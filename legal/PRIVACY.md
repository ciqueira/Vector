# Vector Privacy Policy

[English](PRIVACY.md) · [Português](pt-BR/PRIVACY.md)

Last updated: July 17, 2026

Document version: `vector-privacy-2026-07-17`

This policy describes personal-data processing specifically connected to Vector, its free license, the optional Supporter purchase, operational
email, and product support. The
[Nexus Privacy Policy](https://github.com/ciqueira/MCNexus/blob/main/PRIVACY.md)
separately describes processing required to operate the MCNexus distribution,
activation, update, and security platform.
The seller's [General Privacy Policy](https://legal.magnociqueira.com.br/privacy/)
complements this policy for common purchase and payment processing.

## 1. Controller and contact

The Vector product controller is **56.442.448 MAGNO DIAS CIQUEIRA**,
trade name **Magno Dias Ciqueira**, CNPJ **56.442.448/0001-10**. Service
address: Avenida Augusto de Lima, 233, Belo Horizonte - MG, ZIP 30190-000,
Brazil. Privacy and data-subject requests may be sent privately to
[tools@magnociqueira.com.br](mailto:tools@magnociqueira.com.br).

In the current first-party deployment, Vector and Nexus are maintained
by the same controller but retain separate documents so that product decisions
are distinguishable from platform operations. If Nexus later provides the
service to an independent tenant, that product developer normally controls its
customer, commerce, license, and communication purposes; Nexus processes
tenant-directed data under the applicable service agreement and may separately
control limited data needed for platform security, abuse prevention, and legal
compliance.

## 2. Data and sources

Depending on the action requested, the following data may be processed:

- GitHub account identifier, username, verified primary email, and OAuth state;
- name and email supplied during checkout or support;
- license key, internal license identifier, product, edition, entitlements,
  activation limit, status, and lifecycle dates;
- device or installation identifier, operating system, application/plugin
  version, IP address, approximate country, and activation timestamps;
- Stripe Checkout Session, Payment Link, Price, payment, refund, dispute,
  amount, currency, environment, and customer references, excluding full card
  or bank credentials;
- Supporter start/end dates and support history; and
- operational email delivery, group membership, and automation fields.

Data is received from the user, GitHub authentication, Stripe checkout,
MCNexus/license services, support interactions, and security or delivery logs.
The GitHub OAuth request is limited to the identity information needed for the
license and purchase flow; it is not intended to read private repositories.

## 3. Purposes and legal bases

Data may be processed to:

- issue, recover, activate, validate, protect, and administer the free license;
- verify purchase eligibility and prevent accidental duplicate purchases;
- confirm payment, record the accepted offer, provide Supporter benefits, and
  handle refunds or disputes;
- send license delivery, release, compatibility, maintenance, security, and
  material service notices for Vector;
- answer support and privacy requests;
- prevent fraud, abuse, credential leakage, and security incidents;
- comply with accounting, tax, consumer, regulatory, and court obligations; and
- establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.

The principal LGPD bases are steps requested before a contract and performance
of the license or Supporter contract, compliance with legal or regulatory
obligations, and legitimate interests in proportionate security, fraud
prevention, service reliability, and legal defense. Consent is used where the
law requires it, especially for optional marketing unrelated to Vector. Consent is not bundled as a condition for the free license or paid
support when another legal basis applies.

## 4. Operational communications and marketing

Transactional and operational messages necessary to deliver or administer the
requested Vector license, purchase, security, release information, or
support are kept separate from advertising for other products.

Optional marketing, if introduced, will use a distinct choice and a practical
unsubscribe mechanism. Opting out of marketing does not prevent messages that
are necessary to fulfill an active transaction, security notice, or support
request. Operational data must not be silently reused to build a general
marketing audience.

## 5. Providers and recipients

Only the providers required for the configured flow receive relevant data:

- [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement): identity authentication;
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/br/privacy): checkout, payment, refunds, disputes,
  fraud controls, and receipts;
- OpenKey/Nexus: first-party license records and protected delivery;
- [Cryptlex](https://cryptlex.com/legal/privacy-policy), if a future product
  configuration selects it: license and activation management;
- [MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com/legal/privacy-policy), when enabled:
  operational subscriber fields, group membership, and email automation;
- Cloudflare: public API delivery, security, rate limiting, and edge logs; and
- Neon/PostgreSQL hosting: application, license, and commerce records.

Providers may also act as independent controllers for portions of their own
fraud, compliance, account, and billing operations under their policies.
Personal data is not sold or rented for behavioral advertising.

## 6. International transfers

Some providers and infrastructure may process data outside Brazil. Transfers
must use a mechanism permitted by the LGPD and the applicable ANPD rules,
including contractual safeguards where required. Provider policies identify
their locations and transfer practices.

## 7. Retention

Data is retained only while needed for the stated purpose and applicable legal
periods. In particular:

- active license and activation records are retained while required to provide,
  recover, secure, and administer the license;
- order, payment, refund, dispute, acceptance, and accounting records are kept
  for the periods required by tax, consumer, anti-fraud, and legal-claims law;
- Supporter and operational email records are kept while needed to deliver the
  benefit, demonstrate delivery, respect communication choices, and resolve
  disputes; and
- security logs are retained for limited operational or legally required
  periods and then deleted or anonymized where feasible.

A deletion request may not require deletion of a minimal record that must be
kept by law, is needed to prevent fraud, or is required to establish or defend
legal claims. Where deletion is not possible, processing is restricted to the
remaining lawful purpose.

## 8. Rights

Subject to the LGPD and other applicable law, the data subject may request
confirmation of processing, access, correction, information about sharing,
anonymization, blocking or deletion of unnecessary or unlawful data,
portability where regulated and applicable, review or objection where
available, and withdrawal of consent for future consent-based processing.

Send requests to
[tools@magnociqueira.com.br](mailto:tools@magnociqueira.com.br) with the
registered email and enough information to locate the record. Additional
information may be requested only when reasonably needed to verify identity and
protect the account. Privacy requests must not be posted in public GitHub
Issues. A data subject may also petition the ANPD or an applicable consumer
authority after first contacting the controller where required.

## 9. Security and incidents

Reasonable technical and organizational measures include HTTPS, restricted
administrative access, tenant- and payment-account-scoped secrets, encryption of integration
credentials, payment webhook verification, signed claim links, and minimization
of personal data in logs. No system is completely risk-free. Security incidents
will be assessed and notified as required by applicable law.

## 10. Minors, changes, and contact

Vector is a professional audiovisual tool and is not directed to
children. Personal data from minors is not intentionally requested through the
license or Supporter flow.

Material policy changes will be dated and communicated through an appropriate
product or registered-contact channel. In the payment-account Commerce flow,
the transaction records the configured legal URLs and versions and the
acceptance evidence reported by Stripe.
